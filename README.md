# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting

My homework solutions (in R) of the Ph.D. level statistics course (STAT 626) in Texas A&amp;M University
Reference Book : Time Series - A Data Analysis Approach Using R by Robert H. Shumway, David S. Stoffer

Topics covered:

1) Time Series Elements
2) Time Series Models 
  - White Noise
  - Moving Averages, Smoothing and Filtering
  - Autoregressions
  - Random Walk (with Drift)
  - Signal plus Noise
3) Correlation and Stationary Time Series
4) Time Series Regression and EDA
5) ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) Models
  - Correlations functions
  - Estimation
  - Forecasting
6) ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Models
7) SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Models
8) GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroscedastic) Models

Most of the problems are from the reference book, and the solutions are given in either handwritten or R language. My homework average on the course was around 110% so most of the solutions are good. Please, let me know if you think some of the solutions need to be improved.
